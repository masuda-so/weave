# Implementation References

This bibliography records the primary API, design, toolchain, sample-code, and
product references used while implementing Weave. A reference listed here does
not by itself mean that source code was copied. Exact Apple sample-code portions
used by the app and their license texts are retained in
[Third-Party Notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

Tutorials are comparative references unless an applied scope is explicitly
described here or in the third-party notices. Public API use alone does not mean
sample code was copied.

## Product feature references

- [Create, update, and delete data](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift/create-update-and-delete-data):
  the rendered `MovieList` and `MovieDetail` units are comparative references for
  item-backed creation, deletion, sheet flow, and direct-model editing. Their
  final rendered code isn't present in the starter ZIP, so the ZIP's MIT license
  isn't asserted for those units.
- [Adding and editing persistent data in your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/adding-and-editing-persistent-data-in-your-app)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/f84bac78ac34/SwiftDataAnimals.zip)):
  `AnimalEditor` and `AnimalListView` illustrate optional-model, local-state,
  Save-time update-or-insert, Cancel-without-mutation, and Boolean-sheet
  presentation patterns. Weave retains its validation,
  transactions, rollback, timestamps, share control, and editor presentation.
- [Building a document-based app with SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/building-a-document-based-app-with-swiftui):
  Writing App's `StoryView` supplies the focused `TextEditor` presentation and
  modifier sequence. Its `WritingAppDocument: FileDocument`, `DocumentGroup`,
  document browser, background artwork, and reading sheet are not used because
  Weave retains its SwiftData draft library.
- [`ShareLink`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/sharelink):
  the system share control uses an item and a custom `Label`; this is an API
  contract reference rather than copied sample code.
- [Foundation Models sample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/adding-intelligent-app-features-with-generative-models):
  the downloadable availability switch is a comparison source. Coffee Game and
  Origami, listed below, provide response, cancellation, prompt, and error-handling
  patterns; the app protocol boundary, validation policy, stable vocabulary, and
  product instructions are app-specific.
- [Generate dynamic game content with guided generation and tools](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/generate-dynamic-game-content-with-guided-generation-and-tools)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/86c65aeb21cc/GenerateDynamicGameContentWithGuidedGenerationAndTools.zip)):
  documents nonstreaming `respond(to:)`, response-content, availability, task,
  cancellation, and app-owned-instructions patterns used as implementation guidance.
- [Origami: Crafting a dynamic tutorial for Apple Intelligence](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/origami-crafting-a-dynamic-tutorial-for-apple-intelligence)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/e843a4026a2e/OrigamiCraftingADynamicTutorialForAppleIntelligence.zip)):
  documents the `Prompt` builder, post-response cancellation check, and iOS 27
  Foundation Models error-type branching used as implementation guidance. Dynamic
  profiles, image prompts, streaming, and the sample's cache are not used by Weave.

## Shared platform references

- [Food Truck](https://github.com/apple/sample-food-truck/tree/3954a769e99f3cc53297d94f2b960ceb2665b3d6):
  `General`, `Navigation`, feature folders, and StoreKit transaction listeners.
- [Backyard Birds](https://github.com/apple/sample-backyard-birds/tree/1843d5655bf884b501e2889ad9862ec58978fdbe):
  app-specific feature folders, StoreKit configuration, and adaptive navigation.
- [ml-comlet](https://github.com/apple/ml-comlet/tree/c3811e7367c1a211698078c8ffbc11e282e3c794):
  `Services`, model separation, localization, and `Supporting Files`.
- [Generative AI Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/generative-ai)
  and [Foundation Models acceptable-use requirements](https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/acceptable-use-requirements-for-the-foundation-models-framework):
  people remain in control through explicit AI labeling, cancellation, review guidance,
  a usable non-AI path, and use-case-specific safety boundaries.
- [Instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/instructions):
  developer-owned behavior remains in trusted instructions; user-provided content is
  delimited in the lower-priority prompt and is never interpolated into instructions.

## Platform verification

- [App icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons/)
  and [Creating your app icon using Icon Composer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-your-app-icon-using-icon-composer):
  `Resources/AppIcon.icon` is the sole primary app-icon source. Xcode renders the
  required platform, appearance, and legacy-size variants from its layered artwork.
- [Localizing and varying text with a string catalog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/localizing-and-varying-text-with-a-string-catalog)
  and [Managing your app’s information property list](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/managing-your-app-s-information-property-list):
  interface text uses `Localizable.xcstrings`; the localizable `CFBundleDisplayName`
  and `CFBundleName` values use the target-specific InfoPlist String Catalog.
- [Accessibility fundamentals](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/accessibility-fundamentals):
  standard editors, lists, buttons, and share controls retain inferred semantics.
- [Setting up StoreKit Testing in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/setting-up-storekit-testing-in-xcode/):
  local StoreKit configurations and scheme selection.
- [StoreKit Test](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekittest):
  `SKTestSession` loads the source configuration by URL for product, verified
  purchase and finishing, restore, and Daily Pass boundary tests. Tests run
  serially because all test sessions control one environment; the configuration
  remains outside the app bundle.
- [Understanding StoreKit workflows](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/understanding-storekit-workflows)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/6b864cb1ff7d/UnderstandingStoreKitWorkflows.zip)):
  documents grouped `ProductID` structure and unfinished, current-entitlement,
  update, verified-processing, and `finish()` patterns.
- [Implementing a store in your app using the StoreKit API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/implementing-a-store-in-your-app-using-the-storekit-api)
  ([fixed ZIP](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/623bce0ddaba/ImplementingAStoreInYourAppUsingTheStoreKitAPI.zip)):
  the 2026 sample is used only to cross-check current behavior; no additional
  implementation was taken from this distribution.
- [iOS & iPadOS 26.6 RC Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26_6-release-notes):
  Apple records the earlier iOS 26.5 Simulator `SKTestSession` connection defect
  as fixed under StoreKit (FB22500243). This is historical troubleshooting
  evidence, not a requirement to install an iOS 26.6 Simulator runtime. Xcode
  26.6 ships the iOS 26.5 SDK; Apple does not currently distribute a 26.6
  Simulator runtime. StoreKit end-to-end verification therefore remains gated on
  an Apple-distributed compatible runtime, compatible physical device, or TestFlight.
- [Apple Developer Forums: iOS 26.5 CLI StoreKit report](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/808030):
  historical, non-normative field evidence for the earlier `Code=3` failure and
  IDE-only workaround; it doesn't explain or replace evidence for the iOS 27 run.
- [Select an App Store version release option](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/select-an-app-store-version-release-option/)
  and [Submit an In-App Purchase](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-submissions-to-app-review/submit-an-in-app-purchase/):
  release timing is configured separately from App Review, and each first product
  type is submitted with the initial app version. No current submission date is
  assumed in this repository.
- [Transaction.currentEntitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/transaction/currententitlements):
  the all-product sequence supplies verified current transactions, including the latest
  non-renewing purchase, and the client filters them against the app catalog.
- [Task cancellation and sleep](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task/):
  the Daily Pass monitor retains and cancels its task, uses a cancellable sleep, and
  receives the same injectable wall clock as entitlement calculation.
- [Handling subscriptions billing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/handling-subscriptions-billing):
  app-owned duration, restoration, and cross-device responsibilities for a
  non-renewing subscription.
- [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/):
  role-based type names, labeled weakly typed parameters, clarity at the call site,
  fluent method names, and concise Markdown comments for reusable APIs.
- [Writing](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/writing):
  assistant and commerce diagnostics remain internal, while localized interface errors
  use plain language and give a clear retry action.
- [swift-format](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format):
  the Swift toolchain formatter and strict linter enforce the repository's pinned
  two-space indentation, import ordering, line length, documentation, and
  force-unwrap safety rules. Swift does not prescribe this as the only valid style;
  adopting one identical configuration across the five apps is a local consistency
  decision.

## Implementation notes and local decisions

- [Xcode support](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/)
  and [App Store Connect release notes](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/release-notes/):
  the App Store submission toolchain remains a release gate. Re-run build, test,
  Analyze, and Archive checks with the stable Xcode selected for the final release.
- [Foundation Models updates](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/updates/foundationmodels):
  Swift 6.4 builds map the iOS 27 `LanguageModelError`,
  `SystemLanguageModel.Error`, and `LanguageModelSession.Error` types. A compiler
  condition keeps those SDK-27 declarations out of Swift 6.3 builds; iOS 26 uses
  the common safe fallback without reintroducing the deprecated generation type.
  Origami's downloadable error translation is the comparison source for the
  shared `SystemLanguageModel.Error` and `LanguageModelError` branches.
- [Supporting languages and locales](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels/supporting-languages-and-locales-with-foundation-models):
  locale support is checked before sending a prompt.
- [Preserving SwiftData models](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/preserving-your-apps-model-data-across-launches):
  `ModelContainer`, `ModelContext`, and `@Query` provide local persistence.
- [ModelContext transaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelcontext/transaction%28block%3A%29)
  and [rollback](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/modelcontext/rollback%28%29):
  user-initiated mutations run inside `performTransactionOrRollback(_:)`, so failures in either
  the changes or their save discard the complete pending unit before the app presents an
  error. The wrapper name and shared alert policy are family-wide implementation decisions.
- [Privacy manifest files](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy-manifest-files):
  the manifest currently declares no tracking or collected data. Recheck source
  dependencies and the final Archive with stable Xcode before confirming
  `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes` and App Store privacy answers.

`Resources/AppIcon.icon` is the current shipping icon source. Apple's icon
documentation governs packaging and appearance rendering. Inspect every rendered
appearance and size in a fresh stable-Xcode Archive. The final
determination is the submitted build's App Review; [App Review guideline 2.3.9](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#accurate-metadata)
still requires accurate metadata and sufficient rights. Support case
`20000121467132` is historical correspondence about the former icon.

Apple doesn't prescribe one universal app-folder layout. Weave therefore follows
the recurring official-sample pattern of app, model, service, resource, and
feature-specific groups. The Daily Pass is an app-owned policy: it uses StoreKit's
verified purchase date plus 24 hours and the device wall clock, without a server.

The downloaded samples include their own Apple or MIT license notices. Weave adapts
the relevant patterns instead of redistributing any sample project unchanged.
